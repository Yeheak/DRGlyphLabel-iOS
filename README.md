DRGlyphLabel
============

A simple library that allows you to create glyph labels in UIKit. Concept comes from similiar libraries that allows to use bitmap fonts in 2D game engines like Cocos2d or SpriteKit. In order to generate custom bitmap font, you can use a tool such as [bmGlyph](http://www.bmglyph.com/). Font generated by this tool can be easily used to display text labels in UIKit, thanks to DRGlyphLabel. 

Tested under iOS 7. If you are looking for specific version of the library, checkout those branches:

- [master branch](../../tree/master) - for most recent, development version
- [branch 0.1](../../tree/0.1) - for v0.1.x releases

## Installation

You can install the library using CocoaPods. To do so, you will need to add one of the following lines to your Podfile:

For stable release (recommended):

    pod 'DRGlyphLabel', '~> 0.1.0'

Which creates dependency for version `>= 0.1.0` and `< 0.2`

For most recent or exact development version (not recommended on production):

    pod 'DRGlyphLabel', :git => 'https://github.com/darrarski/DRGlyphLabel-iOS.git', :tag => 'VERSION_TAG'

Where `VERSION_TAG` you should put tag name for given version (ex. "v0.1.0"). It is recommended to set version explicity instead of using most recent version, as backward compatibility is not warranted.

## Usage

Public methods of the library are documented in-code. For detailed examples check out attached demo project.
